## Overview

Developed an innovative IoT-based cigarette bud collection system during the Green Building Hackathon. The project addresses environmental pollution caused by cigarette waste while promoting sustainable practices in public spaces.

## Key Features

- **Smart Detection System**: Implemented computer vision algorithms using Python and OpenCV to detect cigarette buds in designated collection areas.
- **Automated Collection Mechanism**: Designed and programmed Arduino-based robotic arms for automated collection and sorting of cigarette waste.
- **Data Analytics Dashboard**: Built a real-time monitoring system that tracks collection efficiency, waste volume, and environmental impact metrics.
- **Mobile App Integration**: Developed a companion mobile application for maintenance staff to monitor system status and receive alerts.
- **Sustainability Reporting**: Created automated reports showing environmental impact and waste reduction statistics.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware**: Arduino Uno, servo motors, ultrasonic sensors, and custom 3D-printed components
- **Computer Vision**: Python with OpenCV for image processing and object detection
- **Backend**: Python Flask API for data processing and analytics
- **Database**: SQLite for local data storage and analytics
- **Mobile App**: React Native for cross-platform mobile application
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS IoT for device management and data collection

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was integrating hardware components with software systems in real-time. This required learning about IoT protocols, sensor calibration, and edge computing. The project taught me the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between hardware and software development.

## Outcome

The system was successfully deployed in a pilot program at a local university campus, collecting over 500 cigarette buds in the first month. The project won the "Most Innovative Solution" award at the hackathon and is being considered for implementation in other public spaces.
