## Overview

BloodLink is a comprehensive platform designed to bridge the gap between blood banks and hospitals, streamlining the blood donation and distribution process. The system addresses critical challenges in blood management and emergency response.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Inventory Management**: Developed a centralized database system that tracks blood inventory across multiple blood banks in real-time, including blood type, quantity, and expiration dates.
- **Emergency Request System**: Implemented an automated notification system that alerts nearby blood banks when hospitals place emergency blood requests.
- **Donor Management**: Built a comprehensive donor registration and tracking system with health screening questionnaires and donation history.
- **Hospital Integration**: Created APIs for hospitals to seamlessly request blood units and track delivery status.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Developed data visualization tools for administrators to monitor donation trends, inventory levels, and system performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python with Django framework for robust API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and complex queries
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for responsive user interface
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure user authentication
- **Deployment**: Docker containers for scalable deployment

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was ensuring real-time synchronization between multiple blood banks and hospitals. This required implementing efficient database design with proper indexing and real-time communication protocols. The project taught me the importance of data integrity in healthcare systems and the critical nature of reliable API design.

## Outcome

BloodLink successfully connected 5 major blood banks with 12 hospitals in the region, reducing emergency response time by 60% and improving blood inventory management efficiency. The platform is now being considered for expansion to other districts.
